			// difference between double and float
			/*A double variable can provide precision up to 15 to 16 decimal points 
			  as compared to float precision of 6 to 7 decimal digits. 
			  Another significant difference between float and double is 
			  their storage requirement, double is more expensive than float. 
			  It takes 8 bytes to store a variable while float just takes 4 bytes.
